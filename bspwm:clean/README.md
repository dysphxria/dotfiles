[alt text](https://github.com/lindseyontop/dotfiles/blob/master/bspwm:clean/.config/wall.png)
i also have a script to set wallpapers in `./local/bin`.
You can set a wallpaper with `setbg /path/to/image`, or if you give it a directory with images, it will choose a random image. Make sure to edit the line `setbg .wallpapers` in `.config/bspwm/bspwmrc` to your own folder, or if you dont want the functionality you can remove the line enitrely.
