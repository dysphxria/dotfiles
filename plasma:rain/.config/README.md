## install: 
### clone the repository 
``git clone https://github.com/dysphxria/dotfiles.git``
## move the files to the ``.config`` folder

## Colorscheme
### For the colorscheme, install ``pyton-pywal``. It generates a colorscheme based on your wallpaper. 
### ``wal -i dotfiles/plasma:rain/.config/wallpaper/preview.jpg``
### in your ``.zshrc``, add ``cat /home/YOURNAME/.cache/wal/sequences`` for it to load everytime you open the terminal.

## Wallpaper
### For the wallpaper, i used https://github.com/catsout/wallpaper-engine-kde-plugin . Theres probably another way to use a .mp4 file as a wallpaper, but this is what i used.

## KDE Theme: 
### https://store.kde.org/p/1633675

#### done! if this doesnt work please tell me because i've never riced kde plasma before, so i don't really know what files to upload. Have a nice day!
